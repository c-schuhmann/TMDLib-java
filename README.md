# TMDLib-java
## Java library for parsing Nintendo TMD (Title Metadata) files

### Usage & Requirements
1. Get a TMD file.
2. Pass the file to the TMD constructor.
3. ...
4. Profit! You can now use this freshly created TMD object to obtain data from it.

You may want to look into this projects Javadoc for more information.

### Building
You need at least JDK 1.7 and Maven.
Build with `mvn compile`.

### Contributing
This is more or less a project for myself, but if you really want to contribute: 
Give me some advice, what I can do better :)

### Thanks
This project would'nt be possible without [3DBrew](https://3dbrew.org/wiki/Title_metadata)!
The TMD file structure is very well described there.

#### Extra: The reason why I started this project
At the time I'm writing this readme file right now, I'm in the process of learning Java.
I was always a big fan of the Nintendo Homebrew Scene, so I thought: Hey, let's do a Homebrew-themed project!

I really hope that this small "library" will be useful for someone.
